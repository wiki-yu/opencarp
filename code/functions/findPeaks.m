function [peaks,miscOutputs] = findPeaks(signal,opt)
% This function computes local peaks in a set of time signals
% 
% Inputs:
%   signal: a channels x time instant array to be baseline corrected
%   opt: an optional control variable structure with the following fields:
%
% Outputs:
%   peaks: a cell array with peak locations for all signals
%   miscOuputs: an additional structure where other outputs if any can be
%   found
